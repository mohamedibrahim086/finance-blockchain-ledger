# 💰 Finance Blockchain Ledger

A simple Python-based blockchain application that simulates secure financial transactions between users using blockchain principles.

This project demonstrates how blockchain can be applied in the **finance domain** to provide **transparency**, **tamper-proof records**, and **auditability** of transactions.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

In traditional financial systems, fraudulent activities and unauthorized changes to financial records are common due to centralized data storage. There is often a lack of transparency and traceability in transactions.

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

This project creates a **simplified blockchain** to:

- Record transactions between parties
- Ensure data immutability using SHA-256 hashing
- Provide a complete audit trail of financial operations

## 🧠 Key Blockchain Concepts Used

| Concept         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Blocks**      | Units that store transactions and metadata |
| **Chain**       | Each block points to the previous block with a hash |
| **Hashing**     | SHA-256 ensures data integrity and tamper detection |
| **Proof (Simulated)** | Represents mining or validation (not used to secure network in this demo) |
| **Transactions**| Represent money transfer between sender and recipient |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Built-in libraries: `hashlib`, `json`, `time`
